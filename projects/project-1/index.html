	<p>Students will ideate and design a multi-page website.</p>
<p><a href="#project-1a">Project 1A</a></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p><a href="../../assets/documents/Rubric-Project1.pdf">Evaluation Criteria</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a theme based on your interests and likings - e.g. travel, hobby, public event you attended, product or service you use, etc. (<strong>Note:</strong> portfolio projects will not be accepted).</li>
<li>The visual and textual content should be self-generated as much as possible. Content that is not self-generated must be referenced within the site.</li>
<li>Minimum of 4 pages, maximum of 10 pages (should include a home page, as well as at least three additional unique pages e.g. about, services, gallery, etc.).</li>
<li>At least one page must include a minimum 500 word essay with headings and subheadings.</li>
<li>Minimum 5 images.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be careful not to prioritize quantity over quality; building more pages than the requirement doesn’t necessarily mean a better project/grade. Students are expected to produce quality layouts, be original, creative and consistent with their visual language.</p>

<h2 id="project-1a">Project 1A</h2>
<h3 id="proposal-5-">Proposal (5%)</h3>
<p><strong>Due week 2: January 16</strong></p>
<p>Students will choose a theme of their interest and begin the process of planning their approach to this project by addressing/considering the following questions/areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Written Component:</strong> A one page written document outlining:<ul>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> What is the goal of your project (project description)?</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience/Users:</strong> Who are the defined users for this project? What makes these users a defined group (try to identify their demographics, profession, interests, etc.). How would your project help/benefit them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Content Organization:</strong> Provide an organized list of different types/categories of content in your project. There might be more than one way to organize your content. Think about the most obvious (title or category) to the least obvious (interest or theme). A project might have multiple organization themes.</li>
<li><strong>Site Structure (Site Map):</strong> Referring to your theme, content list and their organization scheme, clearly illustrate the structure of your site through a sitemap diagram – use either Adobe Illustrator, OmniGraffle or <a href="https://www.draw.io">Draw.io</a> to show the hierarchy of pages, their relationship and depth level. Include your sitemap diagram in your document.</li>
<li><strong>Copy:</strong> You will need to develop written descriptions and/or anecdotes as part of content requirements for this project (About Business, Mission Statement, Project Descriptions, etc.). Include minimum of three samples of your written copy in your document. <strong>Tip:</strong> The more content you have now, the easier the rest of the project will be.</li>
<li><strong>Images:</strong> You are encouraged to produce/use your own images and photos for this project. But if your subject matter is not accessible and/or you have not developed strong photography skills yet, you can take advantage of online stock photography sites. If you decide to use Royalty Free stock photography, make sure your selected photos follow the same photography style – lighting, macro/micro perspective, framing, colour palettes and staging. You should also document the source (URL) of your chosen stock photography site/images to give credit to the photographer(s) and protect their intellectual property and rights. Include minimum of five samples of your chosen photos and images in your document.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
<li>Written component (goals, audience)</li>
<li>Site stricture/site map</li>
<li>Copy and image samples</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine everything for Project 1A into a single PDF document and submit according to the <a href="../../faq/#class-work-submission-process">class work submission process</a>. Make sure to optimize your PDF file size. The final PDF should be less than 5MB in size.</p>
<p>Bring a copy of your project proposal (B&amp;W print or laptop) to class and be ready for group discussions.</p>
